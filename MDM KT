Challenges:
Data Migration: Migrating data from CIS to IBM MDM can be challenging due to differences in data models and structures.

Integration Complexity: Integrating IBM MDM with existing systems and applications may pose challenges, requiring careful planning and execution.

User Adoption: Users might face difficulties adapting to a new system, affecting productivity during the transition period.

Customization and Configuration: Aligning IBM MDM with specific business needs may require extensive customization, posing challenges in terms of time and resources.

Training: Training staff on the new system is crucial but can be time-consuming and may lead to a temporary decrease in efficiency.

Multiple IDPs:
Using multiple Identity Providers can be driven by the need to:

Diversity of Authentication Mechanisms: Different systems may have unique authentication requirements, leading to the use of various IDPs.

Integration with External Systems: If your organization interacts with external partners or services, using different IDPs can facilitate secure authentication.

Regulatory Compliance: Certain industries or regions might have specific regulations that dictate the use of particular IDPs for compliance purposes.

Existing Challenges:
Details about existing challenges would depend on the specific issues faced by your organization with the current CIS system. These could include outdated technology, scalability issues, data inconsistency, or lack of flexibility.

Existing Landscape:
Understanding your current landscape involves assessing the architecture, technologies, and processes in place with the current CIS system. This includes identifying dependencies, data sources, and integration points.

Key Drivers:
Improved Data Governance: IBM MDM offers enhanced data governance capabilities, ensuring data consistency and accuracy across the organization.

Single Source of Truth: Transitioning to IBM MDM aims to establish a single, authoritative source for master data, reducing data silos and inconsistencies.

Scalability and Flexibility: IBM MDM may provide better scalability and flexibility to accommodate growing data volumes and evolving business needs.

Benefits of the Transition:
Data Accuracy: IBM MDM can improve data accuracy by establishing and enforcing data quality standards.

Efficient Business Processes: With a centralized master data management system, business processes can become more efficient and streamlined.

Enhanced Reporting and Analytics: Improved data quality and consistency contribute to more accurate reporting and analytics.

Regulatory Compliance: IBM MDM can assist in meeting regulatory compliance requirements, especially in industries with stringent data governance regulations.

Reduced IT Costs: Over time, a well-implemented MDM solution can lead to cost savings by reducing data errors, minimizing redundancy, and streamlining data-related processes.

Remember, the success of the transition depends on careful planning, stakeholder engagement, and addressing specific challenges unique to your organization. Always conduct a thorough analysis and consider engaging with experts for a smoother transition.
