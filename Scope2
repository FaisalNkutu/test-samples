The Detailed Scope for High-Level Interaction Diagrams in an Architecture Blueprint outlines the purpose, objectives, inclusions, exclusions, audience, and guidelines for revision and maintenance of these diagrams. The diagrams aim to offer a macroscopic view of a system's key interactions and communication flows, presenting major components and their relationships without overwhelming stakeholders with unnecessary details. Key objectives include representing communication flows, identifying system boundaries, abstracting details, and emphasizing user-system interactions. Major components, interactions, external entities, and data flows are included, while low-level details, error handling, and non-functional aspects are excluded to maintain focus.

The intended audience comprises both technical and non-technical stakeholders, including decision-makers who seek a high-level understanding of the system's architecture and collaboration. The dynamic nature of architecture necessitates periodic revisions to align with evolving systems. Additionally, the diagrams should align with more detailed specifications to ensure consistency. By adhering to this detailed scope, High-Level Interaction Diagrams serve as valuable tools for comprehending and communicating a system's architecture effectively.
