The client data in CIS, also known as party data, encompasses tombstone and contract-related information. Advisor Workspace manages this data through synchronous ETL processes on weekdays. Extracts are created from DB2 tables and loaded into Salesforce. This includes combining contract and party data for advisor relationships. The following day, a new file is generated from CIS extracts and compared to the Salesforce data loaded the previous night. This process identifies business events, including attribute changes in existing contracts.
