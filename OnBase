Context:

OnBase is an image and workflow system for managing documents, storing raw documents such as scanned papers or emails in various formats (PDF, TIFF).
Documents go through a process of scanning, triage, and workflow, eventually reaching business users for processing.
Kiss Interaction:

Kiss is involved in an autofill process where a lookup table in OnBase is used to automatically populate data.
Key interactions involve fetching information from Kiss during the workflow setup to populate OnBase for use as a lookup.
Document Ingestion:

OnBase has multiple ingestion points, including scanning through scanners in the mailroom, XML dips for key data, and sweeps for direct document scanning.
Users may need to index documents manually, prompting the need for autofill processes to streamline this.
