Introduction:
In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, businesses are constantly seeking ways to enhance customer experiences, streamline operations, and improve security. Canada Life, a prominent player in the insurance and financial services industry, recognizes the need to modernize its Authorization and Authentication mechanisms to align with the latest technologies and industry standards. This document outlines the business context and rationale for migrating from Canada Life's legacy Authorization and Authentication system to a more robust solution based on synchronizing Canada Life's Customer Information System through IBM's Master Data Management (MDM), utilizing Salesforce's Role-based access control, and integrating Siebel-based ISAM IDs via Kafka event streaming.

Business Drivers:

Enhanced Customer Experience: The migration aims to create a seamless and personalized customer experience by leveraging up-to-date customer data and streamlining access controls. This will result in quicker response times, personalized services, and improved customer satisfaction.

Efficiency and Productivity: The integration of IBM's MDM and Salesforce's Role-based access control will enable a unified view of customer data and access rights across different systems. This streamlining will reduce redundant processes, minimize data duplication, and enhance operational efficiency.

Security and Compliance: Modernizing the authentication and authorization mechanism enhances data security by implementing industry-leading authentication methods and role-based access controls. This migration ensures compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR and industry-specific standards.

Scalability: The integration of Kafka event streaming for synchronizing Siebel-based ISAM IDs allows for real-time data synchronization, making the system highly scalable and capable of handling increasing volumes of data and user interactions.

Future-Ready Architecture: The adoption of contemporary technologies like IBM's MDM, Salesforce, and Kafka event streaming positions Canada Life for future growth and technology advancements. This architecture provides flexibility to integrate with emerging technologies seamlessly.

Components of the Migration:

IBM's Master Data Management (MDM): This component will serve as the central hub for customer data. It will consolidate, clean, and synchronize customer data across various systems, ensuring a single source of truth for customer information. This integration will contribute to improved data quality, accuracy, and accessibility.

Salesforce's Role-based Access Control: By leveraging Salesforce's robust role-based access control capabilities, Canada Life will be able to define and manage user access based on their roles within the organization. This fine-grained access control will enhance security and ensure that users have the appropriate permissions to access customer data.

Kafka Event Streaming for ISAM IDs: Utilizing Kafka event streaming technology to synchronize Siebel-based ISAM IDs in real-time ensures that access controls are updated promptly across systems. This facilitates consistent and instantaneous authorization for users across different applications.

Migration Strategy:

Requirements Analysis: Detailed requirements will be gathered from stakeholders across various departments, including IT, security, compliance, and customer service. These requirements will inform the design and implementation phases.

Data Mapping and Transformation: The existing customer data in the legacy system will be mapped to the new MDM structure. Data cleansing and transformation processes will be applied to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

Role Definition and Mapping: The roles within Salesforce will be defined, aligned with the organization's structure, and mapped to corresponding access rights. This mapping will ensure that users are granted appropriate permissions based on their roles.

Integration and Development: The integration between IBM's MDM, Salesforce, and Kafka will be developed. APIs and connectors will be set up to enable data synchronization, role-based access control, and real-time event streaming.

Testing and Validation: Rigorous testing will be conducted to verify the functionality, security, and performance of the new authentication and authorization mechanisms. User acceptance testing will ensure alignment with business requirements.

Data Migration and Cut-over: Customer data will be migrated from the legacy system to IBM's MDM. A well-defined cut-over plan will be executed to ensure a seamless transition from the legacy system to the new solution.

Training and Change Management: Training programs will be conducted to educate employees about the new authentication and authorization mechanisms. Change management strategies will be implemented to ensure a smooth transition and user adoption.

Monitoring and Continuous Improvement: Post-migration, monitoring tools will be implemented to track system performance, security incidents, and user activity. Regular audits and updates will be conducted to adapt to evolving business needs and technology advancements.

Conclusion:
The migration from Canada Life's legacy Authorization and Authentication mechanism to the new solution based on IBM's MDM, Salesforce's Role-based access control, and Kafka event streaming represents a significant step forward in terms of customer experience, operational efficiency, security, and future scalability. By aligning with modern technologies and industry best practices, Canada Life is positioning itself for sustained success in an increasingly digital world.
