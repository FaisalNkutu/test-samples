It seems like you're discussing a technical transition from a system called CIS to a Microservice architecture for handling data integration. Here are some key points and considerations based on the information provided:

1. **Transition from CIS to Microservice**:
   - CIS, a 24/7 application, is being removed and replaced with a Microservice architecture.
   - The Microservice will need to handle the same load that CIS used to manage.

2. **Risk of Outages**:
   - There is a risk of outages if the Microservice and Batch/ETL processes are running simultaneously and potentially overwriting records.
  
3. **Real-time Data Refresh**:
   - Abhi and Varun are concerned about ensuring real-time data updates without downtime.

4. **Current Outages and Rejections**:
   - There are ongoing outages and rejections due to the Batch/ETL process not running 24/7.

5. **Replacing Batch/ETL with Real-time Eventing**:
   - The preference is to replace Batch/ETL with Real-time Eventing for integration with MDM (Master Data Management) and MADS (Master Data Service) to enable real-time updates.

6. **Avoiding Record Overwriting**:
   - It's important to ensure that records are not overwritten on a regular basis. Full Eventing and Messaging are preferred if they prevent overwriting.

Based on this information, here are some suggestions:

- Implement real-time event-driven architecture to handle data integration instead of relying on batch processes.
- Ensure that the Microservice architecture is capable of handling the load previously managed by CIS.
- Implement safeguards to prevent simultaneous operations from causing outages or overwriting of records. This might involve using locking mechanisms or implementing appropriate data synchronization techniques.
- Consider using versioning or timestamping to track changes and prevent overwriting of records.
- Monitor the system closely during the transition to identify and address any potential issues.

Remember to consult with your technical team and consider conducting a thorough risk assessment before making any significant architectural changes.
