In blueprints high level interaction diagrams have a role, in illustrating the overall structure and behavior of a system or application. These diagrams mainly focus on the interactions between components or modules highlighting relationships and the flow of information. Let me give you an overview of the scope and benefits of using high level interaction diagrams in blueprints;

System Overview;

High level interaction diagrams visually represent the system showcasing its major components and how they interact with each other.
They help stakeholders such as developers, architects and business analysts quickly grasp the structure of the system.
Communication Flows;

These diagrams highlight how information is exchanged within the system by illustrating communication flows between components.
Stakeholders can use these diagrams to identify communication patterns and potential bottlenecks.
Component Relationships;

The relationships between components in a system are depicted in these diagrams helping stakeholders understand dependencies and interactions for the systems functionality.
This is particularly valuable when considering how changes in one component may impact others.
Functional Perspective;

High level interaction diagrams provide a perspective by emphasizing interactions that contribute to achieving the behavior of the system.
They are particularly useful, during design stages to capture and communicate functionality.

Scalability and Performance;

These visual diagrams can help assess how the system scales and performs by illustrating the interactions that contribute to data flow and processing. Stakeholders can use them to identify bottlenecks, in performance and optimize the systems architecture accordingly.

Decision Support;

High level interaction diagrams are tools for architects and decision makers to make informed choices about system design and architecture. They facilitate discussions on trade offs, design options and potential enhancements.

Documentation;

High level interaction diagrams serve as documentation artifacts providing developers with a reference point while maintaining a shared understanding of the systems architecture over time. They play a role in documenting the architectural design.

Integration Points;

Integration points are often represented by interactions between components. High level interaction diagrams highlight these integration points guiding development teams in implementing and testing interfaces 

In summary high level interaction diagrams serve as tools in the blueprint as they offer a concise yet informative representation of the systems structure and behavior. They foster communication among stakeholders aid, in decision making processes. Contribute to an overall understanding of the systems architecture.
