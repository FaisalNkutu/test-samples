So kiss is the basically the system of record for client records that come into AGM UMM and and do you need a background on AGM like oh OK so so.
0:3:23.910 --> 0:3:28.220
Does, Rob
So what AGM is is it's a, it's an aggregation app.
0:3:28.230 --> 0:3:30.50
Does, Rob
It's a household aggregation tool.
0:3:32.270 --> 0:3:34.400
Does, Rob
And I don't know Debbie.
0:3:34.410 --> 0:3:41.100
Does, Rob
Maybe you can disclaim the business side of it better, but let me try in a in a quick nutshell here, we wanna look at.
0:3:41.110 --> 0:3:54.910
Does, Rob
We wanna see the full value of investments from a household so that we can offer them better fees and and and and and and perhaps rebates depending on the product.
0:3:55.670 --> 0:3:58.750
Does, Rob
Umm, so E you know what?
0:3:58.760 --> 0:4:13.640
Does, Rob
What it is is, is is just a tool to aggregate a contracts or accounts or policies that are held by Members within the same household, and then of course, like you know, based on the product series, they get better pricing.
0:4:15.650 --> 0:4:23.930
Does, Rob
So what happens is we've got two primary sources of accounts, SAS for mutual funds and unitrax for psych funds.
0:4:24.900 --> 0:4:26.310
Does, Rob
These are the primary sources.
0:4:27.300 --> 0:4:34.350
Does, Rob
Unitrax is the book of record for the high net worth agreement, seg funds and SAS at the book of Record for the High Net worth mutual fund agreements.
0:4:36.190 --> 0:4:37.140
Does, Rob
AGG.
0:4:37.150 --> 0:4:40.90
Does, Rob
So there's another type of agreement, right?
0:4:40.100 --> 0:4:42.780
Does, Rob
There's different types of agreements that are held within AGM.
0:4:44.610 --> 0:4:53.20
Does, Rob
So we have a high net worth agreement and then we have a household agreements, the household agreements, those are the book of record for those is actually AGM.
0:4:54.590 --> 0:4:58.440
Does, Rob
We have secondary sources of of accounts as well that feed in.
0:4:59.310 --> 0:5:19.470
Does, Rob
So you know, if somebody has, you know, a seg fund in unitrax and a mutual fund that's in SAS and also has, you know, some GIF's or annuities in other systems, they're all going to get aggregated and fed into fed, into AGM, AGG into the data.
0:5:20.340 --> 0:5:20.600
Nkutu, Faisal
Right.
0:5:20.360 --> 0:5:45.860
Does, Rob
And the way that happens is so basically this side, uh, you know, let's if we look at the high net worth agreements coming out of SAS and Unitrax, they're fed in daily through an ETL job called Interface 95 and and and and so if there's some, if there's a new agreement created in unitrax, it'll come in tomorrow through 95 and into AGG.
0:5:46.810 --> 0:5:58.730
Does, Rob
Then what happens is there's an extract that comes out of AGG on a daily basis through a job called a GO51, and it gets sent through to IDM.
0:6:0.60 --> 0:6:10.710
Does, Rob
Uh IDM basically, you know, looks for new roles and and when we say a role, what that means is a an account.
0:6:11.750 --> 0:6:12.660
Does, Rob
Uh can.
0:6:12.670 --> 0:6:18.280
Does, Rob
We'll have a role relating to an agreement group in AGM, right?
0:6:18.290 --> 0:6:22.420
Does, Rob
So the agreement group is the is the you know the the aggregation of accounts.
0:6:23.810 --> 0:6:29.740
Does, Rob
The role is the relationship between the agreement group and the contracts or or accounts with within it.
0:6:31.590 --> 0:6:38.370
Does, Rob
So every day the the there's a process in in IDM that runs through, looks for new roles relating to.
0:6:40.210 --> 0:6:51.830
Does, Rob
To to the agreements in AGG, it sources client and contract details from KISS and and and so that's where you know that.
0:6:51.840 --> 0:6:57.870
Does, Rob
That's where the the relationship to AGG data comes in here and it is kind of an indirect one as well, right?
0:6:58.820 --> 0:7:2.420
Does, Rob
The Kiss data flows into AGG through or via IDM.
0:7:3.270 --> 0:7:6.50
Does, Rob
Uh, you know, gets built into roles.
0:7:6.60 --> 0:7:12.270
Does, Rob
Gets staged and you know coming down through this process here, you know and and and these ETL jobs here are.
0:7:13.700 --> 0:7:18.440
Does, Rob
Uh, you know, they're looking for associated Records, secondary records.
0:7:19.990 --> 0:7:26.20
Does, Rob
They're looking to see if, if if a role that IDM identified has already been.
0:7:28.10 --> 0:7:29.90
Does, Rob
Input to AGM.
0:7:30.200 --> 0:7:30.830
Does, Rob
Umm.
0:7:31.370 --> 0:7:41.830
Does, Rob
And and and or whether an account is closed and should be removed from an agreement group and also we'll update the market value of accounts.
