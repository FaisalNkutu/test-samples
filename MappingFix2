Excellent question ‚Äî if you're unsure whether you're hitting the **correct MDM endpoint** for your deduplication + automerge workflow, here‚Äôs how to **systematically find the correct endpoint** in IBM MDM.

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step: How to Find the Correct PME-Compatible Endpoint

### üîç 1. **Know What You're Trying to Trigger**
Since you're doing **DeDuplication + AutoMerge**, you want to trigger:

| Goal                  | Trigger Type         |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| PME Match             | `processTx` with `TCRMPersonBObj` |
| AutoMerge             | Defined in `EntityConfig.xml` and rules |
| Web API Endpoint      | RESTful or SOAP endpoint mapped to `processTx` |

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 2. **Search the CompositeServiceConfig.xml**

This file maps:
- **Service names** like `processTx`, `searchXYZ`
- To **objects** like `TCRMPersonBObj`, `TCRMOrganizationBObj`, etc.
- And links to **PME match + merge logic**

**How to find it:**

```bash
find /disk/apps/websphere/ -name "CompositeServiceConfig.xml" 2>/dev/null
```

Then extract it:
```bash
jar xf path/to/matching.jar path/to/CompositeServiceConfig.xml
```

Open the XML and search for entries like:
```xml
<CompositeService name="processTx">
    <ObjectType>TCRMPersonBObj</ObjectType>
    ...
</CompositeService>
```

‚úÖ If this exists, the REST endpoint:
```
POST /com.ibm.mdm.server.ws.restful/resources/MDMWSRESTful
```
is valid for your `TCRMPersonBObj`-based `processTx`.

---

### üîç 3. **Check Installed WSDLs or OpenAPI (if SOAP)**

For SOAP-style interfaces:
```bash
find /disk/apps/websphere/ -name "*.wsdl" | grep -i MDM
```

If you're using the old SOAP interface, the endpoint might be something like:

```
http://<host>:<port>/mdm/services/TCRMService
```

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Test Known Working Payloads**

From your earlier tests:
- This worked:
```xml
<TCRMTxType>searchCBSAPerson</TCRMTxType>
```
‚Ä¶but was **search**, not dedup.

You want:
```xml
<RequestType>processTx</RequestType>
<TCRMTx>
  <TCRMPersonBObj>...</TCRMPersonBObj>
</TCRMTx>
```

Submit it to:
```
POST https://<server>/com.ibm.mdm.server.ws.restful/resources/MDMWSRESTful
```

If it returns:
```xml
<ResultCode>SUCCESS</ResultCode>
```
Or:
```xml
<ResultCode>FATAL</ResultCode> but ErrorMessage contains 'match candidate'
```
‚úÖ Then the PME path is invoked.

---

### üß† 5. **Inspect Logs for PME Match Traces**

Tail this to confirm it‚Äôs hitting the PME:
```bash
tail -f /disk/apps/websphere/AppServer/profiles/MDM32*/logs/*/SystemOut.log
```

Look for:
```
Invoking PME Match
Running auto-merge
Match candidates found
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Task                        | How to Find It |
|-----------------------------|----------------|
| Right endpoint              | Check `CompositeServiceConfig.xml` for `processTx` |
| PME match trigger confirmed | Watch logs: `SystemOut.log` |
| REST compatibility          | Confirm `/MDMWSRESTful` exists and accepts `TCRMPersonBObj` |
| Test auto-merge             | Submit payload, check for resolution/suspect creation |

Would you like me to generate a mock `CompositeServiceConfig.xml` example to help you visually spot the relevant `processTx` entry?
