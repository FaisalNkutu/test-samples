You're doing everything right — and your latest screenshot shows you're now **searching as `was` user**, with access to previously restricted paths.

## ✅ Summary So Far

- You've extracted `com.ibm.mdm.mds.common.jar`
- You're running `grep -i CBSAPerson * -R` across its contents
- No immediate match yet, and no XML or XSD found by name either

---

## 🧠 What This Tells Us

1. The class or config file for `CBSAPersonSearchBObj` **is likely inside another `.jar`** — possibly referenced by `com.ibm.mdm.mds.common.jar`, not contained within it.

2. The **real mappings (CompositeServiceConfig.xml, CBSAPersonSearchBObj.xsd)** are not in that specific `.jar`.

---

## ✅ Next Target: Recursively Scan `.jar` Contents

You now need to **recursively inspect other `.jar` files** in:

```
/disk/apps/websphere/AppServer/profiles/MDM32/installedCBAs/
```

### 🔧 Step-by-Step: Find Config in All JARs

1. Create a working directory:
```bash
mkdir /tmp/mdm-jar-unpack
cd /tmp/mdm-jar-unpack
```

2. Loop through all `.jar` files and scan for CBSAPerson:

```bash
find /disk/apps/websphere/AppServer/profiles/MDM32/installedCBAs/ -name "*.jar" | while read jarfile; do
  echo "🔍 Searching in $jarfile"
  jar tf "$jarfile" | grep -Ei "CBSAPerson|Composite|Transaction" && echo "✅ Found in $jarfile"
done
```

> This will **tell you exactly which jar** contains the config/mapping.

### ✅ When Found:
Extract it with:

```bash
jar xf /full/path/to/matching.jar path/to/CompositeServiceConfig.xml
```

Then upload or paste it here — I’ll help interpret it instantly.
