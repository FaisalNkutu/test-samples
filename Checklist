Integrated Micro-Modernization Strategy Discussion Checklist:

Document Changes from Previous Meeting:

 Remove specific timelines (years and months) and avoid exact commitments.
 Focus on the order of operations rather than precise commitments.
 Express caution about making precise commitments and discuss potential consequences.
 Emphasize the importance of estimates in the micro-modernization process.
 Stress the involvement of delivery teams in the planning and execution process.
Political Aspects, Privacy Concerns, and Recording:

 Consider political aspects when presenting information.
 Remove specific names for privacy in discussions and documentation.
 Record changes made during discussions for future reference.
 Maintain detailed documentation of decisions and considerations.
Project Roadmap Organization and Categorization:

 Discuss the organization of phases in the project roadmap.
 Consider a categorization approach based on low, medium, and high complexity applications.
 Clarify that application-level categorization serves as the basis for project phases.
 Continuously consider changes and adjustments to the project approach.
 Foster adaptability based on evolving discussions and requirements.
Micro-Modernization Approach and Budget Considerations:

 Discuss the application of micro-modernization without a dedicated budget.
 Emphasize pushing for enhancements at an application and process level.
 Identify applications using CIS and plan the transition to MDM.
 Classify applications into low complexity for immediate transition to MDM.
Implementation and Presentation of Micro-Modernization Strategy:

 Implement the micro-modernization strategy based on team priorities.
 Use low complexity integration points as a foundation for the overall strategy.
 Confirm whether low complexity points are prerequisites for medium and high complexity.
 Present the strategy diagrammatically with low, medium, and high complexity layers.
 Clarify the chronological approach of accomplishing low complexity tasks first.
 Emphasize showcasing common capabilities and potential parallel execution.
 Create interim states representing low, medium, and high complexity with deliverables.
 Seek confirmation and input from delivery teams for clarity in the strategy.
Flexibility in Timeline and Switch to MDM:

 Acknowledge that the presented timeline is not set in stone.
 Discuss the timing of switching from CIS to MDM and potential milestones for the switch.
Micro-Modernization Approach Checklist:

 Select a simple application for the basic POC (e.g., Address Update).
 Establish two-way communication between CIS and MDM.
 Demonstrate the feasibility of micro-modernization.
 Present benefits for the chosen use case.
 Identify an application with medium complexity for the extended POC.
 Implement two-way communication and replication with MDM.
 Showcase scalability and broader benefits.
 Highlight improvements achieved in the extended POC.
Pattern-Based Documentation:

 Document common patterns for micro-modernization.
 Showcase application interactions with MDM using established patterns.
 Emphasize simplicity and effectiveness of chosen approach.
 Create a reference for future implementations.
Gantt Chart Preparation:

 Identify dependencies and sequence of micro-modernization tasks.
 Establish milestones and timelines for each application.
 Develop a visual roadmap for the entire micro-modernization process.
 Highlight phased approach to avoid a Big Bang budget.
Archival Data Strategy:

 Discuss strategies for handling archive data during micro-modernization.
 Plan for the migration of archive data during system shutdown.
 Address concerns related to maintaining historical data integrity.
 Propose solutions for managing archive data effectively.
Senior Leadership Presentation:

 Summarize benefits demonstrated in POCs.
 Showcase Gantt chart and phased implementation plan.
 Address concerns and gain feedback from senior leadership.
 Seek approval and support for the micro-modernization strategy.
Initiative for Foundational Infrastructure:

 Assess the readiness of foundational infrastructure (e.g., Kafka queues).
 Collaborate with the integration team to set up basic infrastructure.
 Determine estimates and timelines for foundational elements.
Engagement with Application Teams:

 Present the micro-modernization approach to application teams.
 Provide documentation and patterns for integration with MDM.
 Encourage teams to evaluate their applications for micro-modernization.
 Collaborate with teams to create initiative briefs for specific applications.
Follow-Up Meetings:

 Schedule follow-up meetings with integration and application teams.
 Track progress of foundational infrastructure setup.
 Adjust Gantt chart and roadmap based on feedback and progress.
This consolidated checklist encompasses the entire micro-modernization strategy discussion and implementation process, ensuring a systematic and thorough approach to the initiative.
