Since you're missing the official BatchProcessor.sh tool, but you do have the PME runtime jars, I‚Äôll guide you to build a custom Java runner to invoke PME batch matching directly.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Build a Custom PME Batch Runner
üîπ Step 1: Identify Required JARs
You will need to gather the following JARs (found in your search):

com.ibm.mdm.mds.pme.api_11.6.0.11-202001172108.jar

com.ibm.mdm.mds.pme.core_11.6.0.11-202001172108.jar

Possibly:

mdmutils.jar

mdmenginecore.jar

mdmhubcommon.jar

üü° Many of these are located under:

swift
Copy
Edit
/disk/apps/websphere/AppServer/profiles/MDM32/config/bundlecache/
Create a directory, e.g., /home/fxn703/mdm-pme/lib/, and copy those .jar files into it.

üîπ Step 2: Build a Custom Java Command to Run PME
Create a script runPMEBatch.sh:

bash
Copy
Edit
#!/bin/bash

# Path to Java
JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java11
JAVACMD=$JAVA_HOME/bin/java

# Path to your copied jars
LIB_PATH=/home/fxn703/mdm-pme/lib

# Input files
INPUT=/home/fxn703/batch/input/persondata.unl
REV=/home/fxn703/batch/config/person_review.rev
PROFILE=/home/fxn703/batch/config/person_automerge_profile.xml
LOG=/home/fxn703/batch/logs/match_log.txt

# Build classpath
CLASSPATH=$(find $LIB_PATH -name "*.jar" | tr '\n' ':')

# Run PME batch match
$JAVACMD -cp "$CLASSPATH" com.ibm.mdm.pme.batch.BatchMatchProcessor \
  -in $INPUT \
  -rev $REV \
  -profile $PROFILE \
  -log $LOG
üîÅ Adjust class name if it's not BatchMatchProcessor. We will verify it in the next step.

üîπ Step 3: Verify the Correct PME Entry Class
To find the actual PME batch match entry class, run this:

bash
Copy
Edit
jar tf /home/fxn703/mdm-pme/lib/com.ibm.mdm.mds.pme.api_11.6.0.11-202001172108.jar | grep -i batch
You're looking for a class like:

swift
Copy
Edit
com/ibm/mdm/pme/batch/BatchMatchProcessor.class
If it's not there, try the same on pme.core or other .jars.

Once confirmed, update your script‚Äôs com.ibm.mdm.pme.batch.BatchMatchProcessor line if needed.

üîπ Step 4: Run It
bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x runPMEBatch.sh
./runPMEBatch.sh
üìå Optional: Validate Configuration Files
Make sure:

.unl is formatted correctly and matches .cfg

.rev is an empty or existing review file

.xml is your automerge profile

.imm and engine-metadata.xml are in the right relative path (if used)

üõ† If Class Not Found or Error
Let me know:

The result of jar tf ... | grep -i batch from your jars

The full error (e.g., ClassNotFoundException or NoClassDefFoundError)

And I can adjust your command or write a Java launcher class if needed

Would you like me to:

Help you identify all .jar files needed to copy?

Write a working batchprocessor.cfg file for your .unl input?
