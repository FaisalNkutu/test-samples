You're working on an essential project named Bill 64. We're exploring the possibility of leveraging your work to integrate with the MDM migration effort from CIS. The challenge is that Bill 64 aims to delete over-retained policies from upstream systems like Ingenium, unitrax, and univeris, which store information in CIS.

The proposed solution involves sending a message from Ingenium to a messaging queue, triggering a purge command in CIS. Simultaneously, MDM, listening to the same delete command, removes the record. Currently, CIS and MDM are interconnected, necessitating a cleanup routine.

While it would be ideal to eliminate CIS, budget constraints prevent rewriting all interfaces. The suggestion is to focus on the EWMS and cap Intel systems, addressing data integrity issues in customer address information.

EWMS can become the intake for customer and address data, validated and updated by MDM. Cap Intel, instead of receiving a feed from EWMS, reads the message from MDM, ensuring synchronized, high-quality data.

This proposal aligns with your initiative, offering a strategic roadmap based on business priorities. The goal is to gradually replace systems dependent on CIS with MDM, addressing immediate issues while setting the foundation for a broader transition.

In a recent meeting, Michelle Barbary discussed addressing wealth address issues, emphasizing the importance of aligning your proposal with their requirements.

The vision involves preventing the propagation of unvalidated addresses and data, ensuring that only MDM-validated information flows through the systems.

This approach not only solves immediate problems but also sets the stage for a comprehensive transition away from CIS.
