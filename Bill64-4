Bill 64 aims to simplify data management by removing unnecessary policies from systems like Ingenium, unitrax, and univeris, which all store data in CIS. The proposed solution involves triggering a cleanup in CIS through a message from Ingenium. Simultaneously, MDM will remove corresponding records. While budget constraints prevent removing CIS entirely, the focus shifts to improving data integrity in EWMS and downstream applications. This aligns with MDM's goal of being a single source of truth, setting the stage for a gradual transition away from CIS.
