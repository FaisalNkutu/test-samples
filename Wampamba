Thank you for the detailed screenshot — you're navigating the native WAR structure precisely. Here's what we've confirmed and what you should do next:

---

## ✅ Summary of What You've Found

- You are inside:
  ```
  /disk/apps/websphere/AppServer/profiles/MDM32/installedApps/DmgrNodeCell/MDM-native-MDME001.ear/native.war/
  ```
- Inside `WEB-INF/` you found:
  ```
  web.xml
  ```

**But no `lib/`, no `.jar`, and no `CompositeServiceConfig.xml` are present here.**

---

## 🧠 What This Tells Us

- The configuration files (`CompositeServiceConfig.xml`, `TransactionInputConfig.xml`, etc.) and the actual logic **are not part of `native.war`**.
- Instead, they are likely embedded in a separate **custom `.jar`** or **CBA-deployed component**.

This is typical in IBM MDM when:
- The `.cba` (Composite Bundle Archive) is used to install services.
- Those files are deployed to OSGi containers, not inside the `.ear` or `.war` file.

## ✅ What You Should Do Next

### 🔍 1. Search inside the `installedCBAs` directory

Run:

```bash
find /disk/apps/websphere/AppServer/profiles/MDM32/installedCBAs/ -type f -name "*.jar"
```

Then check which of those `.jar`s are large (size > 100KB) and likely to contain mappings:

```bash
ls -lh /disk/apps/websphere/AppServer/profiles/MDM32/installedCBAs/**/*.jar | sort -k5 -h
```

Once identified, run:

```bash
jar tf <jarfile> | grep -Ei "Composite|CBSAPerson|Transaction"
```

Example:

```bash
jar tf com.ibm.mdm.cbsapersonservice.bundle.jar | grep -Ei "CBSAPerson|Composite"
```

---

### 📦 2. You’re Likely Looking for a JAR like:

- `com.ibm.mdm.*.bundle.jar`
- `cbsapersonservice*.jar`
- Anything with `pme`, `search`, or `transaction` in the name

---

## 🎯 Goal:

You want to locate files like:
- `CompositeServiceConfig.xml`
- `CBSAPersonSearchBObj.xsd`
- `TransactionInputConfig.xml`

Once found, they will confirm:
- How `CBSAPersonSearchBObj` maps to `PER*` fields
- Which PME attributes are used (e.g., `PERLEGALNAME`, `PERDOCUMENT`)
- Whether scoring, bucketing, etc. are happening as expected

---

Would you like to upload one of those `.jar` files once you locate it? I can extract and decode the config for you.
