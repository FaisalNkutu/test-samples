**IT Support Process after Migration to IBM's MDM at Canada Life:**

Following the successful migration from Canada Life's legacy Customer Information System to IBM's Master Data Management (MDM) system, the IT support process undergoes transformation to align with the new technology landscape and ensure seamless operations. The revamped support process is designed to address technical issues, optimize user experiences, and maximize the benefits of the MDM system.

**1. Issue Reporting and Logging:**
Users and stakeholders can report technical issues or concerns related to IBM's MDM system through designated channels, such as a dedicated support portal, email, or phone. Reported issues are logged into a central tracking system for efficient management.

**2. Issue Prioritization and Categorization:**
Upon receiving an issue report, support personnel assess the severity and impact of the issue to assign an appropriate priority level. Issues are categorized based on their nature and potential impact on business processes.

**3. Troubleshooting and Diagnosis:**
Experienced support teams utilize their expertise and knowledge of IBM's MDM system to diagnose reported issues. They analyze system logs, perform tests, and gather additional information from users to identify the root cause accurately.

**4. Resolution or Escalation:**
Once the root cause is determined, support personnel work to resolve the issue using the capabilities of the MDM system. Complex or critical issues are escalated to higher-level support or specialized teams with in-depth knowledge of the MDM solution.

**5. Communication and Updates:**
Transparent communication is a cornerstone of the support process. Users receive regular updates on the progress of issue resolution, ensuring they are aware of the steps being taken and the expected timeframes for resolution.

**6. Documentation and Knowledge Management:**
After successfully resolving an issue, support personnel document the steps taken, solutions applied, and any relevant information. This documentation contributes to a knowledge base that facilitates quicker resolutions for similar issues in the future.

**7. User Training and Guidance:**
Support teams offer guidance, training, and best practices to users to optimize their interactions with the MDM system. This proactive approach reduces the occurrence of user-related issues.

**8. Feedback and Continuous Improvement:**
Users are encouraged to provide feedback on their support experiences. This feedback is invaluable for identifying areas of improvement in the support process and enhancing the overall user satisfaction.

**9. Collaboration and Vendor Support:**
In situations requiring technical assistance beyond the organization's capabilities, support teams collaborate with IBM's support services to address complex or product-specific issues.

**Benefits of the Enhanced IT Support Process:**

1. **Seamless Operations:** A streamlined support process ensures that technical issues are addressed swiftly, minimizing disruptions to business operations.

2. **Maximized MDM Benefits:** Efficient issue resolution allows users to fully leverage the capabilities of IBM's MDM system, enhancing data management and decision-making.

3. **User Empowerment:** Users receive guidance and training, enabling them to make the most of the MDM system and reducing user-related support requests.

4. **Data Accuracy and Quality:** Effective support contributes to maintaining accurate and reliable master data within the MDM system.

5. **Adaptability and Scalability:** The support process is adaptable to accommodate future changes, upgrades, and expansions within the MDM environment.

6. **Continuous Enhancement:** Feedback and documentation contribute to a continuous improvement cycle, optimizing the support process over time.

The revamped IT support process after migrating to IBM's MDM system at Canada Life ensures a user-centric approach, effective issue resolution, and a collaborative environment for leveraging the full potential of the MDM solution.
