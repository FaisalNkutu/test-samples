Here is the cleaned-up version of the text with improved grammar and clarity:

1. If a customer purchases a policy using the Admin System:

2. The request is then forwarded to CIS in order to create a customer master record.

3. Subsequently, the request reaches MDM, which contains a comprehensive single view of the customer.

4. MDM then transmits the information to Salesforce bidirectionally. This process involves:

   a. MDM registering new customers, while Salesforce generates a Customer record and sends back an SF identifier.
   
   b. Salesforce creating a Contact record.

5. When a user authenticates through My Canada Life (MyCL):

   a. Salesforce submits the Salesforce identity to APIGEE and generates a JWT or SAML via APIGEE's Tokens API, based on OAuth 2.0.
   
   b. A User record is established containing the identity record from MyCL, derived from the Policy number and Postal Code. Once a match is found, a link between Contact and User Records is established.

6. In case the system/user attempts to access any of the Business APIs via APIGEE, the Data Layer Security (DLS) Microservices are invoked. This is achieved by passing an APIGEE JWT, constructed by APIGEE and containing an SF ID. The authorization rules are defined within DLS.

   a. The Microservices operate with their cache called Microservices Aligned Data Stores (MADS). MADS looks up the SF ID to determine relationships, such as customer policies, and so on. MADS obtains its data from MDM. Multiple microservices exist for different lines of business, including Contracts, Agreements, each with its own data store.

   b. Note that User Onboarding is present in Salesforce; ideally, it should interact with MDM. However, we have duplicated that data in Salesforce. This duplication process is referred to as the PartySync Mechanism (Minute 17:41).

Lastly, the mentioned information pertains to a single Customer IdP interaction through Salesforce. If Quadrus has been implemented, there's a possibility of a second non-Canada Life vendor IdP. It's recommended to consult the Business to determine whether they have access to the Dealer System for Mutual Funds.
