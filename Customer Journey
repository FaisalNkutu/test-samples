From the Advisor's perspective, the Siebel platform contains the Siebel ID, while ISAM is linked with Siebel. To ensure synchronization among these systems and with Salesforce, Kafka comes into play, facilitating data alignment, and subsequently, all the data is stored in the database.

This approach offers a notable advantage: it lays the groundwork for future activities. When a user logs in, the Microservices Aligned Data Storages (MADS) located near Siebel (at 13:48 and 7) come into action. This interaction involves the CloudEntity, which manages various IDs like PeopleSoft ID, Mainframe IDs, and more. CloudEntity effectively processes Single Sign-On requests, seamlessly integrating users into different applications and even launching the relevant ones automatically.

For the user, the process is straightforward. They select the desired application, initiating a Single Sign-On experience. However, it's important to note that neither OKTA nor CloudEntity offers storage capabilities encompassing Entitlements and Credentials. This responsibility falls on Canada Life to provide. While OKTA and CloudEntity excel at data access, authentication, and authorization services, the actual storage of entitlements and credentials rests with Canada Life.

To ensure streamlined functionality, it's essential to consolidate the entitlements of each application. A structured approach is necessary; for instance, organizing entitlements like GBP (presumably a reference to currency or some specific functionality). This organization is pivotal for effective management and seamless user experience.
