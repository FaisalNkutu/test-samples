Thanks — based on the WSDL list you provided, you **do not have `CompositeServiceConfig.xml`**, but you **do have WSDLs**, which means you're using **SOAP-based endpoints**, not REST Composite Services.

---

## ✅ Your Best Matching Endpoint: `TCRMService` (SOAP)

From your WSDL paths, this one is key:

```
/MDM-web-services-virtual-MDME001.ear/ibminitiatews.war/wsdl/IdentityHub.wsdl
```

This usually corresponds to the classic MDM SOAP service:
```
https://<host>:<port>/ibminitiatews/TCRMService
```

## 🧪 What You Can Do Now

### ✅ Use `processTx` Over SOAP with `TCRMPersonBObj`

Send a payload like this:

```xml
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
                  xmlns:urn="http://www.ibm.com/mdm/schema">
  <soapenv:Header/>
  <soapenv:Body>
    <urn:TCRMService>
      <urn:RequestType>processTx</urn:RequestType>
      <urn:TCRMTx>
        <urn:TCRMPersonBObj>
          <urn:PartyType>Person</urn:PartyType>
          <urn:TCRMPersonNameBObj>
            <urn:FirstName>KOMAL</urn:FirstName>
            <urn:MiddleName>CHRISTINA KAUR</urn:MiddleName>
            <urn:LastName>BAHIA</urn:LastName>
          </urn:TCRMPersonNameBObj>
          <urn:TCRMPersonCharacteristicBObj>
            <urn:BirthDate>1952-08-08</urn:BirthDate>
          </urn:TCRMPersonCharacteristicBObj>
          <urn:TCRMPartyBObj>
            <urn:Gender>1</urn:Gender>
            <urn:Citizenship>31</urn:Citizenship>
          </urn:TCRMPartyBObj>
          <urn:TCRMPartyIdentificationBObj>
            <urn:DocumentType>13</urn:DocumentType>
            <urn:DocumentNumber>AN579239</urn:DocumentNumber>
          </urn:TCRMPartyIdentificationBObj>
        </urn:TCRMPersonBObj>
      </urn:TCRMTx>
    </urn:TCRMService>
  </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
```

## 🔍 How to Confirm Endpoint

If you're unsure about the correct host and port, check your WebSphere Admin Console:

1. Go to `Servers > Server Types > WebSphere Application Servers > [Your Server]`
2. Under **Web Container**, check the host and port
3. Validate:
   ```
   https://<host>:<port>/ibminitiatews/TCRMService?wsdl
   ```
   in a browser or SoapUI

## ✅ Summary

| You Want                | Use                                             |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| AutoMerge via PME       | `TCRMService → processTx` with `TCRMPersonBObj` |
| Your interface style    | SOAP (based on `IdentityHub.wsdl`)             |
| REST Composite not used | No `CompositeServiceConfig.xml` present         |

Would you like a SoapUI project template for testing this endpoint directly?
