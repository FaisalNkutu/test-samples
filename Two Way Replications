The existing data flow between CIS and MDM shows synchronization for most data, except for mutual funds and FM policy-related information.

A prior attempt to replicate address fields from MDM to CIS via Kafka was started but discontinued midway due to testing and other reasons.

The Two-Way Replication Effort from CIS to MDM aims to implement and conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing for a seamless data flow between the two systems. This ensures the integrity of the data flow, confirming that MDM data aligns completely with CIS and is interchangeable.
