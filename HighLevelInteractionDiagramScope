Scope for High Level Interaction Diagrams in an Architecture Blueprint:

Overview:
The High Level Interaction Diagrams in the Architecture Blueprint aim to provide a comprehensive representation of the system's key interactions and communication flows at a macroscopic level. These diagrams serve as a visual tool to illustrate the major components and their interactions within the architecture.

Key Objectives:

Communication Flow Representation: Illustrate the primary communication pathways and interactions between major system components, highlighting the flow of information and control.
System Boundary Identification: Clearly define the boundaries of the system and external entities, establishing a context for the interactions captured in the diagram.
Abstraction of Details: Maintain a high level of abstraction, focusing on the major components and their interactions without delving into the intricacies of internal processes or specific data flows.
User-System Interactions: Highlight key interactions between end-users or external systems and the core components of the system, emphasizing the user-system interface.
Inclusions:

Major Components: Identify and represent the major system components and their roles in the overall architecture.
Interactions: Capture the essential interactions and communication channels between components, emphasizing the sequencing and nature of the interactions.
External Entities: Include external systems, users, or services that interact with the system, showcasing how the architecture accommodates external inputs and outputs.
Data Flow: Illustrate the flow of data between components, emphasizing the types of data exchanged and the purposes of these exchanges.
Exclusions:

Low-Level Details: Omit low-level implementation details, algorithms, or specific technologies from the diagram to maintain a focus on the overarching architecture.
Error Handling: Avoid diving into detailed error-handling processes or exception flows; instead, concentrate on the primary, successful pathways.
Non-functional Details: Exclude non-functional aspects (e.g., performance metrics, security protocols) at this high level, as they are better suited for detailed specifications.
Audience:

Technical and Non-Technical Stakeholders: The diagrams should be accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, providing a high-level understanding of the system's architecture and interactions.
Decision Makers: Enable decision-makers to grasp the system's design philosophy, major components, and how they collaborate to achieve the system's objectives.
Revision and Maintenance:

Dynamic Nature: Acknowledge that the architecture and interactions may evolve over time. Plan for periodic revisions to ensure that the diagrams accurately reflect the current state of the system.
Alignment with Detailed Specifications: Maintain consistency with more detailed specifications and diagrams, ensuring that the high-level interactions align with the lower-level design elements.
By adhering to this scope, the High Level Interaction Diagrams aim to provide a valuable tool for stakeholders to comprehend the system's architecture without getting bogged down by excessive details.
