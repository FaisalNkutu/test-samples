## üß† Current Findings:

| Observation | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| You're deep inside the EAR structure: `/MDM-native-MDME001.ear` | ‚úÖ You are now in the correct deployed MDM application |
| Search for files like `CompositeServiceConfig.xml`, `TransactionMappings.xml`, or anything containing `CBSAPerson` returned nothing visible | ‚ùå These files are likely packaged **inside a `.jar`** or compressed archive ‚Äî not as raw XML on disk |

---

## ‚úÖ What to Do Next

You‚Äôll need to extract them from inside the `.ear` or its embedded `.jar` files:

---

### üîß Step-by-Step: Extract from `.ear` or `.jar`

#### 1. Navigate into the EAR:
```bash
cd /disk/apps/websphere/AppServer/profiles/MDM32/installedApps/DmgrNodeCell/applications/MDM-native-MDME001.ear/
```

#### 2. Look for `.jar` files inside `native.war`:
```bash
cd native.war/WEB-INF/lib
ls -l
```

You should see something like:
```
mdm-custom-cba.jar
mdm-pme-wrapper.jar
```

---

#### 3. Extract target config from jar:
Pick one `.jar` file and run:
```bash
jar tf mdm-custom-cba.jar | grep -Ei "CBSAPerson|Composite|Transaction"
```

If you find:
- `CompositeServiceConfig.xml`
- `TransactionMappings.xml`
- `CBSAPersonSearchBObj.xsd`

‚Ä¶then extract them:
```bash
jar xf mdm-custom-cba.jar path/to/CompositeServiceConfig.xml
```

---

### ‚úÖ Want Faster Insight?

If you‚Äôd like, upload one of those `.jar` files (e.g., `mdm-custom-cba.jar`) here, and I‚Äôll:
- Extract all mapping/config files
- Show you exactly how `CBSAPersonSearchBObj` maps to your PME engine

Would you like to proceed with extracting from a specific `.jar`, or upload it here for analysis?
