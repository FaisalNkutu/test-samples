CIS is a system. It is designed to identify the person, incorporating all the identifying features such as first name, last name, date of birth, and gender. Additionally, marital status is recorded. The system also includes specific insurance-related information like age at admission, Social Insurance Number (SIN), or Australian Social Insurance Number.

Each client's profile contains a list of their policies. Alongside each policy, there is information about the type of contract it entails, as well as the system on which that policy is administered. This setup allows for each client's information to be presented in a coherent and organized manner, akin to a structured narrative on a screen.
