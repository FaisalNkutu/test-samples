Bill 64 aims to remove excess policies from upstream systems like Ingenium, unitrax, and univeris, all of which store data in CIS.

The proposed solution involves Ingenium sending a message to a messaging queue, triggering a purge command in CIS. Simultaneously, MDM listens for the same delete command and removes the corresponding record. Currently, CIS and MDM are interconnected, requiring a cleanup routine.

Although eliminating CIS would be ideal, budget constraints prevent rewriting all interfaces. The suggestion is to concentrate on EWMS and downstream applications like Cap Intel systems, addressing data integrity issues in customer address information.

EWMS can serve as the intake for customer and address data, validated and updated by MDM. Instead of receiving a feed from EWMS, a downstream system reads the message from MDM, ensuring synchronized, high-quality data.

This proposal aligns with the initiative of MDM as a single source of truth, providing a strategic roadmap for the CIS to MDM migration based on business priorities. The goal is to gradually replace systems dependent on CIS with MDM, addressing immediate issues while setting the foundation for a broader transition.

The wealth address team is a potential adopter of this strategy.

The vision involves preventing the propagation of unvalidated addresses and data, ensuring that only MDM-validated information flows through the systems.

This approach not only solves immediate problems but also sets the stage for a comprehensive transition away from CIS.
