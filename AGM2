AGM Overview:

AGM is described as an aggregation app and a household aggregation tool.
Its purpose is to evaluate the full value of investments within a household.
The goal is to offer clients better fees and potential rebates based on their investment products.
Data Sources:

Two primary sources of accounts are mentioned: SAS for mutual funds and Unitrax for seg funds (possibly segregated funds).
High net worth agreements are stored in Unitrax, while high net worth mutual fund agreements are in SAS.
AGM serves as the book of record for household agreements.
Agreements and Data Flow:

Different types of agreements, including high net worth and household agreements, are managed within AGM.
Data from various sources, such as seg funds in Unitrax and mutual funds in SAS, are aggregated into AGM.
Data Integration:

Daily ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs, such as Interface 95, are used to bring data from SAS and Unitrax into AGM.
A daily extract job, GO51, sends data from AGM to IDM (Identity Management?).
IDM looks for new roles (relationships between agreement groups and accounts) and sources client and contract details from KISS.
KISS Integration:

KISS appears to be a system that stores client records.
IDM uses KISS data to build roles related to agreements in AGM.
Data Verification and Maintenance:

IDM checks for associated records, secondary records, and updates market values of accounts.
It ensures that roles identified by IDM are not duplicated in AGM and handles closed accounts.
Overall Process:

The overall process involves a flow of data from various sources into AGM, with IDM playing a crucial role in managing relationships and client details.
