Thank you — your search results confirm that:

> ✅ The IBM MDM Probabilistic Matching Engine (PME) **runtime JARs are present**, but **the BatchProcessor.sh script is not installed** on this environment.

## 🎯 Goal: Run MDM PME Matching in IBM MDM 11.6 Without `BatchProcessor.sh`

Since you're missing the official `BatchProcessor.sh` tool, but **you do have the PME runtime jars**, I’ll guide you to **build a custom Java runner** to invoke PME batch matching directly.

## ✅ Step-by-Step: Build a Custom PME Batch Runner

### 🔹 Step 1: Identify Required JARs

You will need to gather the following JARs (found in your search):

- `com.ibm.mdm.mds.pme.api_11.6.0.11-202001172108.jar`
- `com.ibm.mdm.mds.pme.core_11.6.0.11-202001172108.jar`
- Possibly:
  - `mdmutils.jar`
  - `mdmenginecore.jar`
  - `mdmhubcommon.jar`

🟡 Many of these are located under:
```
/disk/apps/websphere/AppServer/profiles/MDM32/config/bundlecache/
```

Create a directory, e.g., `/home/fxn703/mdm-pme/lib/`, and copy those `.jar` files into it.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Build a Custom Java Command to Run PME

Create a script `runPMEBatch.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Path to Java
JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java11
JAVACMD=$JAVA_HOME/bin/java

# Path to your copied jars
LIB_PATH=/home/fxn703/mdm-pme/lib

# Input files
INPUT=/home/fxn703/batch/input/persondata.unl
REV=/home/fxn703/batch/config/person_review.rev
PROFILE=/home/fxn703/batch/config/person_automerge_profile.xml
LOG=/home/fxn703/batch/logs/match_log.txt

# Build classpath
CLASSPATH=$(find $LIB_PATH -name "*.jar" | tr '\n' ':')

# Run PME batch match
$JAVACMD -cp "$CLASSPATH" com.ibm.mdm.pme.batch.BatchMatchProcessor \
  -in $INPUT \
  -rev $REV \
  -profile $PROFILE \
  -log $LOG
```

> 🔁 Adjust class name if it's not `BatchMatchProcessor`. We will verify it in the next step.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Verify the Correct PME Entry Class

To find the actual PME batch match entry class, run this:

```bash
jar tf /home/fxn703/mdm-pme/lib/com.ibm.mdm.mds.pme.api_11.6.0.11-202001172108.jar | grep -i batch
```

You're looking for a class like:

```
com/ibm/mdm/pme/batch/BatchMatchProcessor.class
```

If it's not there, try the same on `pme.core` or other `.jar`s.

Once confirmed, update your script’s `com.ibm.mdm.pme.batch.BatchMatchProcessor` line if needed.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Run It

```bash
chmod +x runPMEBatch.sh
./runPMEBatch.sh
```

---

## 📌 Optional: Validate Configuration Files

Make sure:
- `.unl` is formatted correctly and matches `.cfg`
- `.rev` is an empty or existing review file
- `.xml` is your automerge profile
- `.imm` and `engine-metadata.xml` are in the right relative path (if used)

---

## 🛠 If Class Not Found or Error

Let me know:
- The result of `jar tf ... | grep -i batch` from your jars
- The full error (e.g., `ClassNotFoundException` or `NoClassDefFoundError`)
- And I can adjust your command or write a Java launcher class if needed

---

Would you like me to:
- Help you identify all `.jar` files needed to copy?
- Write a working `batchprocessor.cfg` file for your `.unl` input?

Let me know what’s next!
