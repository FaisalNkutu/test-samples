There are two different types of applications for the customer intake journey: one for accepting paper applications and another for electronic applications. New Business applications (NB) are used for this purpose, including NB WebApp, Simple Protect, AURA, and LOPA. 

These applications assist in processing insurance applications and determining the appropriate insurance coverage amount. They also assess the customer's risk profile. Once all assessments are completed, insurance is issued to the customer.

Once insurance is issued, customer information is transferred to Policy Administration applications, which include Ingenium 5.4, Ingenium 7, IB, FM, and others.

The strategic direction is to merge all policy administration systems into one, specifically Ingenium 7.
