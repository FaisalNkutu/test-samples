In the end state, MDM will be the only place with Master Records containing client data and addresses; it 

Receives event messaging from MADS Environment 

Performs Event Processing; validates, verifies, approves and fixes addresses then 

Publishes the data as an MDM Golden Copy. 

Currently, the Golden Copy is consumed by CIS and the Microservice and everything is kept in synch using Event Messaging. 

CIS is a 24/7 highly stable and highly resilient application, which will be replaced by MDM, so in order to integrate more systems directly to MDM via a Microservice, they will need to take the load that CIS took. In order to do so, it is recommended to; 

Switch to the proposed real-time event-driven architecture to handle data integration between MDM to Microservice Aligned Data Storage (MADS) and sunset the current nightly batch ETL synch process between MDM and MADS.  

In the meantime, implement safeguards to prevent simultaneous operations from causing outages or overwriting of records in MADS. This might involve using locking mechanisms or implementing appropriate data synchronization techniques. 

Consider using versioning or timestamping to track changes and prevent overwriting of records. 

Monitor the system closely during the transition to identify and address any potential issues. 

Ensure that the Microservice architecture is scalable and can handle the load previously managed by CIS.
