MDM will be the only place with Master Records (Client Data and Addresses) - it 

Receives event messaging from MADS Environment 

Does Event Processing; Validates, verifies, approves and fixes Addresses  

Publishes an MDM Golden Copy. 

Initially - The Goldent Copy was consumed by CIS and the Microservice - Everything was kept in synch using Event Messaging 

CIS is a 24/7 highly stable and highly resilient application, which will be replaced by MDM, so if we are hooking up more systems directly to MDM via a Microservice- They need to take the Load that CIS took.
