Thank you — the screenshot confirms that:

---

## ❌ Directory `/disk/apps/websphere/AppServer/profiles/MDM32/installedCBAs/` does not exist

That’s likely because:
- Your MDM environment deployed the `.cba` via a **different profile** (like `MDM32-2`)
- Or the `installedCBAs` directory is placed under a **shared `AppServer` directory**, not inside a specific profile

---

## ✅ Try These Locations Instead

Run this search at the AppServer level:

```bash
find /disk/apps/websphere/AppServer/ -type f -name "*.jar" | grep -i installedCBAs
```

If that fails, widen the scope:

```bash
find /disk/apps/websphere/ -type f -name "*.jar" | grep -i installedCBAs
```

Once you locate a path like:
```
/disk/apps/websphere/AppServer/installedCBAs/com.ibm.mdm.xxx.bundle.jar
```

Run this:

```bash
jar tf /full/path/to/that.jar | grep -Ei "CBSAPerson|Composite|Transaction"
```

---

## 📦 Alternative (based on known installations)

You can also try:
```bash
cd /disk/apps/websphere/AppServer/installedCBAs/
ls -l
```

Or:
```bash
find / -type d -name "installedCBAs" 2>/dev/null
```

Would you like a command to **extract all XML/XSD files from all JARs** in one go?
