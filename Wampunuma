Excellent work ‚Äî you‚Äôve now uncovered the full set of deployed `.jar` files from:

- `native.war`
- `installedEBAs`
- `installedApps`

From your output, the most **promising lead** is this `.jar` file:

```
installedApps/DmgrNodeCell/MDM-native-MDME001.ear/native.war/lib/com.ibm.mdm.mds.common.jar
```

This one likely contains or references:
- `CBSAPersonSearchBObj` class or schema
- `CompositeServiceConfig.xml` or `TransactionInputConfig.xml`
- PME-triggering logic (based on "common" naming in IBM MDM)

---

## ‚úÖ Next Step: Extract and Search Inside

Please do the following:

### üîç 1. Copy the `.jar` file somewhere safe (optional but recommended)
```bash
cp installedApps/DmgrNodeCell/MDM-native-MDME001.ear/native.war/lib/com.ibm.mdm.mds.common.jar /tmp/
cd /tmp/
```

### üîç 2. Extract its contents:
```bash
jar xf com.ibm.mdm.mds.common.jar
```

### üîç 3. Search for mapping/config/XSD:
```bash
find . -type f \( -name "*.xml" -o -name "*.xsd" \) | grep -Ei "CBSAPerson|Composite|Transaction"
```

Also try:
```bash
grep -i CBSAPerson * -R | less
```

You're looking for any of:
- `CompositeServiceConfig.xml`
- `TransactionInputConfig.xml`
- `CBSAPersonSearchBObj.xsd`
- Any `.java` file or `.class` with `CBSAPerson` in name

---

## ‚úÖ If Found:
Please upload the XML or XSD file(s) and I will:
- Explain the PME field mappings
- Confirm what attributes it uses (`PERDOCUMENT`, `PERLEGALNAME`, etc.)
- Link them back to your `.alg` and `.imm`

Would you like me to walk you through automated scripting to extract multiple `.jar` files and scan for `CBSAPerson` if needed?
