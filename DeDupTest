Thank you for the update ‚Äî let‚Äôs fix this completely.

If SoapUI still doesn‚Äôt show requests after importing the simplified project, then it‚Äôs likely:

### üîç Root Cause:
The `.xml` file is still being treated as a **SoapUI Test Suite project**, not a native **REST request project**.

---

## ‚úÖ Definitive Fix: Build It Manually (Takes 2 Minutes)

Here's how to **manually create the REST test** in SoapUI that always works:

---

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step (Manual Creation)

#### üß© Step 1: Create a New REST Project

1. Open SoapUI
2. Go to: **File ‚Üí New REST Project**
3. For the URL, paste:
   ```
   https://ec01ld6632.isvcs.net:9443/com.ibm.mdm.server.ws.restful/resources/MDMWSRESTful/party
   ```
4. Name the project: `MDM Dedup`

Click **OK** ‚Äì this creates a working REST method.

---

#### üß© Step 2: Configure the Request

1. Click the **request** under the new project
2. In the **Method dropdown**, select **POST**
3. In the **Media Type**, choose **application/json**
4. In the **Headers tab**, add:
   ```
   Authorization: Basic Y2lyMm1kbV9yZXF1ZXN0ZXI6cEBzc3cwcmQ=
   Content-Type: application/json
   Accept: application/json
   ```

---

#### üß© Step 3: Paste JSON Body

In the **request body** tab, paste:

```json
{
  "PartyType": "Person",
  "FirstName": "KOMAL",
  "MiddleName": "CHRISTINA KAUR",
  "LastName": "BAHIA",
  "BirthDate": "1992-08-08",
  "Gender": "1",
  "Document": {
    "DocumentType": "13",
    "DocumentNumber": "AN972945",
    "IssuingCountry": "268"
  },
  "Citizenship": "31"
}
```

Then **click Submit** (green play button).

---

### ‚úÖ Do the Same to Add "Near Duplicate"

Repeat Steps 1‚Äì3 above, and change:
- `FirstName`: `KAMAL`
- `DocumentNumber`: `AN972946`
- `BirthDate`: `1992-08-09`

---

### ‚úÖ Let Me Help Automate in Postman Instead?  
If SoapUI keeps blocking this flow, I can generate a ready-to-import **Postman Collection** ‚Äî which is better suited for REST.

Would you prefer a Postman version now?
